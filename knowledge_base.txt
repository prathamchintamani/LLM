# SparkleBot Inc. Employee Handbook - Internal Document

## Company Mission
Our mission at SparkleBot Inc. is to build autonomous, glitter-dispensing robots that bring joy and sparkle to homes and offices worldwide. We believe in a future where every surface can be just a little more fabulous.

## Remote Work Policy
SparkleBot Inc. operates on a hybrid model. All employees are required to be in the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays for collaboration days. The other days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) are flexible, and employees can choose to work from home or the office. Any exceptions must be approved by your direct manager.

## The "Sparkle Core" Project
The "Sparkle Core" is our next-generation, patented glitter distribution engine. It uses a proprietary blend of compressed air and electrostatic charge to ensure an even, clog-free glitter-dusting experience. The project lead is Dr. Evelyn Reed. The expected launch is Q4 of this year.

## Vacation and Time Off
All full-time employees receive 20 days of paid vacation per year. This is in addition to 5 sick days and all standard national holidays. Vacation time accrues monthly and does not roll over to the next year, so please use it!
